# Never be Clever - Herman Brood
```
[First Verse]
A                    E
Going down the line, my head up high

F#m                D
Wonder why it´s so hard to feel fine

A              E
Got all I need Plastic teeth

F#m                            D
A pocket full of speed and I´m cool with the heat

    E
I got a groovy little lady seems I´m waisting her time

      F#m              D
Got a hit and a bullet still back in crime

E
People say I used to do better

  F#m                     D
I guess I´m gonna have to get myself together

[Chorus] (x2)

          A         E   F#m
But I'll never Ooh aah aah

      D        A
I'll never be clever

[Second Verse]

A                      E
Some say I´m suicidal, with a sense of humour

F#m                    D
Some say I´m faking it all, trying to start rumours

A                 E
Some people say a moment lasts longer

F#m                            D
I find myself at home, settled down, write a song

E
I´ll love to hang around in black people´s places

F#m            D
    Fascinated staring at faces

E
Holy mama, make me concentrate

F#m                       D
Got to write a song and I got to create
